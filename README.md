# CoffeeHouse DLTC

CoffeeHouse Deep Learning Classification Engine is a method for creating K2 Models on large data
to predict labels from them. For example, you can train the model on a bunch of "Sports" articles
and "Political" articles (with the appropriate labels assigned to each article) and train the
model. You can give the model a new article that's either "Sports" or "Political" related and 
the model will be able to predict the likely-hood of the article being Political or Sports related.

This was forked from [magpie](https://github.com/inspirehep/magpie) but rewritten to handle data
and the training process more quickly and efficiently than the original project.
